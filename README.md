# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.  To facilitate the analysis, the following tasks were applied:
- Perform a multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the MPG of MechCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspencion coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Perform t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.  Write a summary interpretation of the findings 
for each statistical analysis.
